                        I am currently enrolled in college, where I am studying Level 3 BTEC Games Development. I am learning how to work in Unreal Engine 5, and I am learning how to use the visual blueprints system to create games. I am also learning other industry standard software such as Blender, Substance Painter, and Adobe Photoshop for use in areas such as 3D modelling, texturing, concept art, and more.
                        <br /> <br />
                        I was awarded Student of the Year for my work in the first year of the course, where I achieved full Distinction marks in my projects. I am currently working towards achieving the same in my second year. My plan after college is to go to university, where I will continue studying either Games Development or Games Programming in hopes of becoming a programmer in the games industry.
