                    TeleportationCrystals is a customisable paper plugin for Minecraft 1.19.4 servers. I created this server plugin to learn about coding in Java.
                    <br /> <br />
                    This plugin adds teleportation crystal items to your server, which can be used by players to save a location within an item in their inventory. This item can then be used to warp back to the saved location. Crystals will break after a customisable number of uses, and also have a customisable crafting recipe.

                    Surveillance State is a game created in late May 2023 using the Unity engine. It was created for a college project.
                    <br /> <br />
                    This game is a first-person horror experience where you must monitor surveillance cameras for anomalous incidents whilst taking measures to ensure that you do not lose your mind.
                    <br /> <br />
                    This game was heavily inspired by the likes of "I'm on Observation Duty" and "Five Nights at Freddy's".

                        Trakt is a platform that keeps track of shows and movies you watch.
                        <br /> <br />
                        After initially updating my yearly lists and statistics manually, I decided to create a program to automate this process. This program has gone through several iterations, with varying levels of automation. The most recent and current version of this program was created in April 2023, and is entirely automated, it uses the Trakt API to retrieve data about my watched shows and movies. This data is then used to update my yearly lists and generate in-depth yearly statistics about my viewing habits. This program is written in Python.
                        <br /> <br />
                        This program is currently only intended for personal use and is coded specifically for my Trakt account. However, I may explore the possibility of making this program more accessible in the future and allowing others to use it.
